 <!-- Beginning of documentation setup. Uses common DOCTYPE html for the set up and included title, meta, links and fonts for use in future reference. starting small to make sure I meet project deadline and expand as needed\*
    The next part of the code I used was for the background of the webpage and being eligible to scroll down since the webpage needs a little more space than intented. starting to assemble the header for the page
    and start the process for putting my title to the website and hopefully quick links and a screen reader for the users -->
